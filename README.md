# Roman numeral Kata in Ruby

## Objective

1) Use TDD to develop code to convert integers to roman numerals.

2) Consider the numbers 1 - 3999

    I = 1
    V = 5
    X = 10
    L = 50
    C = 100
    M = 1000
    XCIX = 99   
    CMXCIX = 999 
    MMMCMXCIX = 3999

3) If you have time, try doing the reverse ie. converting from integers to roman numerals.

4) You have 2 hours!  


## My Solution

My solution was developed using rspec and the rspec-given gem.
